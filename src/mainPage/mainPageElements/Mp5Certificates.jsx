                            <p>In this course I learned tons of things about what is web developement and how to code from a first place instructor. The information given in this course was great was not enough to dive deep in web developement. After this course, I thought that I need to move forward with a JS library that is React.js. I was not sure about the option that I chose. Thats why, I want to get an extra introduction for JS libraries. I rate 4 out of 5 this course.</p>

                            <p>In this course I had a chance to get an introduction to several JS libraries and deecide what to choose for my own future career. The informations given in this course was incredibly useful for me. I really loved the instructor. I decided to move forward with React.js. Also, decided to get his React.js course to move forward. I rate this course 5 out of 5.</p>
